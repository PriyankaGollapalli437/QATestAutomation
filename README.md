# Project Information:
I have wrote standalone code for all the above Testcases in class files TestCase1, TestCase2, TestCase3 under QAExams package in src/test/java respectively.

I have refactored the code by using page Objects model, Abstraction and Inheritance by creating class files under src/main/java respectively.

Refactored testcases are in TC1, TC2, TC3 Class files under QAExams package in src/test/java respectively.

BaseTest.java is the file having all before and other methods and driver initializations. It is under QAExams.testComponents under src/test/java. 
GlobalData properties are wrote inGlobalData.properties file under QAExams.resources package.
Each class file TC1, TC2, TC3 extends BaseTest.java file.

Tests.java class file has all the three test cases and it is under QAExams package in src/test/java respectively.
